# Todo APP

This simple page app was created following a tutorial from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) 

It was my first introduction to **React** and using

- useState()
- useEffect()
- Components
- Props
- localStorage
- .jsx classes
- arrow functions within HTML
- short-circuiting logic

<hr>

Future Goal: 

- add new features
- change styling
- add TailwindCSS
- reuse Todo somewhere else on the site
- add unique elements
